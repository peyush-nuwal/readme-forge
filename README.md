## 💡 Why I Built This

Creating a great GitHub profile shouldn't require wrestling with markdown syntax or boring copy-paste templates.  
**Readme Forge** was built to make the process visual, fast, and actually enjoyable — especially for developers who care about first impressions.

I wanted a tool that felt modern, customizable, and developer-first — so I built it


## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Gained a deeper understanding of **Zustand** and state management best practices  
- Improved **component structure** and dynamic rendering performance  
- Debugged UI issues related to **drag-and-drop interactions** and conditional rendering
